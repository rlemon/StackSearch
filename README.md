#Stack Search
*Easily search your favorite Stack Exchange sites with this context menu extension*

- The **Options** page allows you to add and remove sites from the context menu list.
- The **pop-up** page is on hiatus until I decide if it is in fact needed.
- The ***Site List*** is intentially left blank to start. Because I could not think of a good list of defaults I decided to let you decide.
